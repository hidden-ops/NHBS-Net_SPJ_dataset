# NHBS-Net_SPJ_dataset

The dataset for the standard plane judgment (SPJ dataset) includes a total of 50 cases of DDH images without the seven key structures annotated, of which 25 cases are standard and 25 cases are substandard. The inclusion and scanning of the standard cases were performed in the same way as for the NHU dataset. The ratio of normal and abnormal hip joints (or types I and II) is 1:1. The substandard cases were selected from the clinical practice of the same center and were divided into the following five categories according
to the possible conditions that occur in clinical practice: 
* a) nonmiddle plane
* b) lack of a chondro-osseous border
* c) poor labrum display
* d) incomplete bony roof or poor display of the lower limb of the os ilium
* e) poor display of the joint capsule and perichondrium synovial plica
There were five images of each type. The standard plane gold standard judgment for this dataset was provided by two sonographers with more than five total years of experience in pediatric hip ultrasound.
